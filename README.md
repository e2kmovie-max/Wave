# Wave

Synchronized video watch-party platform. Drop in a link, share a room, and
watch in lockstep with your friends — from the web (Google sign-in) or from
inside Telegram (bot + Mini App). Both identities can be linked into a single
account.

> **Status:** Stage 4 of 5 — bot OP gate, admin panels, multi-account cookie
> rotation, and instance management. On top of Stages 1–3, the bot now
> blocks room creation behind a configurable set of required Telegram
> channels, and admins manage required channels, the Google cookie pool, and
> streaming instances both from a new `/admin` command in the bot and from
> the new `/admin` pages in the web app. Bot strings live in a small RU/EN
> table picked by `language_code`. Auto-rotation on bans/captchas and the
> i18n polish for the web app arrive in Stage 5.

## Quickstart (local dev)

1. **Install Bun** and clone the repo.

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
   git clone https://github.com/e2kmovie-max/Wave.git && cd Wave
   ```

2. **Install dependencies.**

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Bring up MongoDB.**

   ```bash
   bun run db:up
   ```

4. **Configure environment.** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in what
   you have. With both Google OAuth and the bot empty, the app still runs —
   sign-in buttons render in disabled / informational mode so you can see the
   flow.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   The minimum to flip on Google sign-in:

   ```env
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
   ```

   The minimum to flip on the Telegram bot + Mini App:

   ```env
   BOT_TOKEN=123456:abc
   BOT_USERNAME=wave_together_bot
   ```

5. **(Optional) Run a local streaming instance.** The Stage 2 Go binary lives
   at `apps/instance` and ships in a Docker image alongside `yt-dlp` and
   `ffmpeg`.

   ```bash
   docker compose --profile instance up -d
   ```

   Then point the master at it via `INSTANCES_JSON` in `.env`:

   ```env
   INSTANCES_JSON=[{"name":"local","url":"http://localhost:8080","secret":"dev-instance-secret-change-me","isLocal":true}]
   INSTANCE_LOCAL_SECRET=dev-instance-secret-change-me
   ```

   The master upserts that record on startup and pings `/health` every
   `INSTANCE_HEALTH_INTERVAL_SECONDS`. Records added through the future admin
   panel are never overwritten by this sync — see
   [`packages/shared/src/instance-sync.ts`](./packages/shared/src/instance-sync.ts)
   for the matching rules.

6. **Run the apps.** In two terminals:

   ```bash
   bun run dev:web   # http://localhost:3000 (custom Next server + WebSockets)
   bun run dev:bot   # long-poll (skipped automatically if BOT_TOKEN is empty)
   ```

## Auth flows

- **Google OAuth** — OAuth 2.0 authorization-code flow, callback at
  `/api/auth/google/callback`. State is HMAC-signed (carries an optional
  `linkUid` when used to link Google to the currently signed-in user) so we
  don't need a server-side state store.
- **Telegram Mini App** — `apps/web/src/app/miniapp/page.tsx` loads
  `telegram-web-app.js`, posts the raw `initData` to `/api/auth/telegram`,
  and the server verifies the HMAC per the
  [official spec](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#validating-data-received-via-the-mini-app)
  inside `packages/shared/src/telegram.ts`.
- **Account linking** — `/account` exposes "link Google" and "open Telegram
  bot" actions. Both flows accept an existing session and merge identities
  onto the current Wave user, with conflict detection (`google_already_linked`
  / `telegram_already_linked`) when the identity is already on a different
  account.

## Streaming instances (Stage 2)

Each instance is a stateless Go process you can run on any host. The master
node holds the cookie pool, picks a healthy instance for a room, and forwards
`/info` and `/stream` calls to it — cookies are sent **in the request body**
and are never persisted on the instance.

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /health` | none | Liveness + reported `yt-dlp` / `ffmpeg` versions + active stream count. |
| `POST /info` | HMAC | Runs `yt-dlp --dump-single-json` and returns trimmed metadata + format list. |
| `POST /stream` | HMAC | Pipes `yt-dlp` → `ffmpeg` (always remuxes to fragmented MP4) directly to the response body. |

**Signing.** Every signed request carries:

```
X-Wave-Timestamp: <unix seconds>
X-Wave-Signature: hex(hmac_sha256(timestamp + "." + body, instanceSecret))
```

The instance enforces a ±30s clock-drift window so captured signatures cannot
be replayed indefinitely. Same algorithm is used by the master
([`packages/shared/src/instance-client.ts`](./packages/shared/src/instance-client.ts))
and the instance ([`apps/instance/internal/auth/hmac.go`](./apps/instance/internal/auth/hmac.go))
and is pinned by parity tests in `packages/shared/test/`.

**Cookies.** Sent as a JSON array on the request body matching the Chrome
DevTools Protocol cookie shape (`name`, `value`, `domain`, `path`, `expires`,
`secure`, `httpOnly`). The instance writes a 0600 Netscape file to the OS
temp dir, hands it to `yt-dlp --cookies`, and `defer`-deletes it after the
request — nothing about the cookie persists across requests.

## Watch-party rooms (Stage 3)

Signed-in users can create rooms from the home page by pasting a video URL.
The master node:

1. selects an enabled, healthy instance with available stream capacity;
2. rotates to the least-recently-used enabled `GoogleAccount` cookie record
   when one exists;
3. calls the instance `/info` endpoint to build preview metadata and quality
   presets;
4. stores the selected instance, metadata, participants, and sync state on the
   `Room` document.

The room page at `/rooms/<code>` streams through
`/api/rooms/<code>/stream?format=...`, so clients never talk to the worker
instance directly. Playback state is synchronized over the custom Next server's
WebSocket upgrade route:

```
ws(s)://<web-host>/api/rooms/<code>/sync
```

Messages support `play`, `pause`, `seek`, and `quality`; every update is also
persisted to MongoDB so late joiners receive the current playhead. A plain HTTP
instance URL (`http://ip:8080` or `http://localhost:8080`) is allowed because it
is only called from the trusted master node.

## Schemas (Mongoose + InferSchemaType)

All in `packages/shared/src/models`:

| Model | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `User` | Wave user with optional Google and Telegram identities. Holds OP state, last `start` payload, admin flag. |
| `Room` | A watch party: video metadata, participants, current playhead, selected `Instance`, and optional bot invite payload. |
| `Instance` | A Go streaming instance with HMAC secret, health stats, optional cap on parallel streams. |
| `GoogleAccount` | Pool of YouTube cookies (Netscape format, AES-256-GCM at rest). Rotation logic lands in Stage 4. |
| `RequiredChannel` | Telegram channels users must join before creating/joining a room (admin-managed). |

## Bot + admin panel (Stage 4)

### Required-channel gate (OP — “обязательная подписка”)

When the bot receives a video URL (or a deep-link `/start` payload), it
checks `getChatMember` for every enabled `RequiredChannel`. If anything is
missing, the bot:

1. Stores the pending action (`create_room`/`open_room`) on the user's bot
   session.
2. Sends the subscription prompt with one button per channel + a
   *“I subscribed — continue”* button (`op:continue`).
3. On the next callback re-runs the check and either replays the pending
   action or surfaces *“still missing”* via the callback answer.

The same gate applies to web room creation **only when the signed-in user
has a linked Telegram identity** — pure Google users have no way to
subscribe and are never blocked. The web check uses the Telegram Bot HTTP
API directly (no grammY instance needed), so it works inside Next.js route
handlers.

With an empty `RequiredChannel` collection the gate is a no-op for everyone.

### Deep-link invites (`t.me/<bot>?start=<payload>`)

When a room is created from inside the bot, a random `botPayload` is saved
on the `Room`. The bot sends the invite link
`https://t.me/<BOT_USERNAME>?start=<payload>`. Recipients who open that
link and clear OP receive the room URL back from the bot.

### `/admin` in the bot

Users in `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_IDS` get an `/admin` command that opens a menu with
three sub-panels:

- **Required channels** — add (forward a channel post, paste `@username`,
  paste a `-100…` chat-id), toggle enabled, delete.
- **Google cookie pool** — paste a Netscape `cookies.txt` blob or a JSON
  cookie array via a conversation. Records rotate LRU at stream time and
  can be paused (`disable`) or removed.
- **Streaming instances** — add admin-owned instances (`name`, base `url`,
  `INSTANCE_SECRET`), enable/disable any record, delete admin-owned ones.
  `INSTANCES_JSON`-managed records are flagged `env` and protected from
  deletion.

All admin text is rendered through the small RU/EN i18n table keyed by
`ctx.from.language_code` (`ru*` → RU, anything else → EN).

### `/admin` in the web app

Admin web pages live under [`apps/web/src/app/admin`](./apps/web/src/app/admin)
and are guarded by [`apps/web/src/lib/admin-access.ts`](./apps/web/src/lib/admin-access.ts).
A user becomes an admin by one of:

- having `isAdmin:true` on their Wave doc (e.g. an `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_IDS`
  user who signed in to the bot at least once);
- having their Google email listed in `ADMIN_GOOGLE_EMAILS`. On the first
  visit to `/admin` from an env-listed email, `isAdmin` is sticky-set on
  the doc so the env list only needs to seed admins.

The pages are convenient for pasting large cookie blobs (textarea) and for
at-a-glance lists with health flags; the bot panel is the quick-access
path for the same data.

## Environment reference

See [`.env.example`](./.env.example) for the full list. Required at minimum:

- `MONGODB_URI`
- `APP_SECRET` — used by `signToken` / `verifyToken` and AES-256-GCM cookie
  encryption. Generate with `openssl rand -base64 48`.
- `PUBLIC_WEB_URL` — used to build OAuth redirect URIs and bot deep links.

## Roadmap
